This patch allows you to dock your switch while still using the internal speakers as audio output.

# Why?
Not all monitors have speakers.

# How do I install?
Acquire a modded switch with Atmosphere. Download `nro` file from [release page](https://github.com/paulocode/switch_internal_speakers_nro/releases), copy to `switch` folder.

# How do I disable this?
The setting will reset after undocking.

# Known issues/Troubleshooting
* When docked and enabled, volume can only be changed via the physical buttons or though this app.
* Because this locks your audio device, this may prevent other audio device form working until disabled.
